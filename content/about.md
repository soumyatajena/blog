Hi there! I'm <b>Soumyata Jena</b> 🙋‍♀️ — a passionate, curious, and impact-driven <b>.NET Developer</b> 👩‍💻 with nearly <b>6 years</b> of experience building sleek, scalable web apps using <b>C#, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, SQL Server, and Azure</b> ☁️.

I specialize in bringing ideas to life through clean architecture and intuitive UX. Whether it’s building a full-stack solution or diving deep into cloud-native services, I thrive on solving real-world problems with <b>modern web technologies</b> 💡.

Outside of work, I’m a proud <b>manga nerd</b>📙, <b>K-drama enthusiast</b> 🎬, and <b>art explorer</b> 🎨. These creative passions inspire my coding journey. I'm also learning <b>Korean</b> (안녕하세요!) and occasionally pen down thoughts & stories ✍️.

- 🔹 Full-stack .NET magic (C#, Blazor, MVC, SQL)
- 🔹 Cloud-native know-how (Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage)

🎯 <b>Current Focus</b>:
- 🧱 Building my personal portfolio site (hello there 👋)
- ☁️ Deep diving into <b>Azure</b> & <b>Blazor WebAssembly</b>
